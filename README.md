# System-Volume-Control-using-Hand-Gesture
This project utilizes computer vision techniques to detect hand gestures through a webcam feed. By leveraging the MediaPipe library, it recognizes various hand gestures in real-time and translates them into system commands. With this interactive system, users can control their devices by simply gesturing in front of the camera.
Python project that enables users to control their devices using hand gestures. By detecting hand movements through a webcam feed, the system translates these gestures into system commands, allowing for intuitive interaction.
