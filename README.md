# System-Volume-Control-using-Hand-Gesture
This project utilizes computer vision techniques to detect hand gestures through a webcam feed. By leveraging the MediaPipe library, it recognizes various hand gestures in real-time and translates them into system commands. With this interactive system, users can control their devices by simply gesturing in front of the camera.
